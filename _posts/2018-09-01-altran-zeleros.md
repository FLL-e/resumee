**DATE** Third quarter of 2018

This was exciting. We were collaborating with Zeleros, a spanish company that is developing an hyperloop based system. 

I participated in the first stages of development of this new high-speed method of transport, in the areas of communication, power and instrumentation, writing some of the technical documentation, guidelines and proposals for the development

**DATE** Third quarter of 2018

This was exciting. We were collaborating with [Zeleros](https://zeleros.com/), a spanish company that is developing an hyperloop based system. 

I participated in the first stages of development of this new high-speed method of transport, in the areas of communication, power and instrumentation, writing some of the technical documentation, guidelines and proposals for the development.

There were very interesting and motivated people pushing this project, I really hope the best for the team

During this time **I was working in 3 projects simultaneously**. But look at that happy face tho

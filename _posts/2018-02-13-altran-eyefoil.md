**DATE** 2018

I worked in Altran collaborating with Eyefoil developing [Naia](https://www.elcorreo.com/economia/eyefoil-corta-vuela-20181008194358-nt.html), an innovative hydrofoil with active control surfaces:

I worked modelling some subsystems and debugging the Simulink model of the boat. In the area of control, I developed (designed and run several simulations) of the algorithm for the boat stabilization. The actuators were the angles of attack of the hydrofoils.

Part of this time **I was working in 3 projects simultaneously**.

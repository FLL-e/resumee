**DATE** Most part of 2020

Working in the I+D department of FEMA, I developed [this](https://fema.es/news/lp4-indicador-autoalimentado-display-rojo/) indicator.

We face some challenges, like the low consumption yet bright display. We do a lot of experimentation with individual leds (angle of difusion, ultra low power leds, filters and methods for light difumination...). Finally we managed to get it working with 7 segment commercial display, a custom red filter to enhance brightness and an adaptative control for display brightness. Also we faced some difficulties with microcontroller integrated hardware _(we were pushing it to the limits of the specifications)_ and with the calibration part, designing a different-to-FEMA-standard calibrator

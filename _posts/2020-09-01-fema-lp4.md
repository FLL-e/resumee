**DATE** Most part of 2020

Working in the I+D department of FEMA, I developed [this](https://fema.es/news/lp4-indicador-autoalimentado-display-rojo/) indicator. 

We face some challenges, like the low consumption yet bright display. We do a lot of experimentation with individual leds (angle of difusion, ultra low power leds, filters and methods for light difumination...). Finally we managed to get it working with 7 segment commercial display, a custom filter to enhance brightness and an adaptative control for display brightness. Also we faced some difficulties with microcontroller integrated hardware, because it was running out of specifications (yes, I learned the importance of review the datasheet errata...) and with the calibration part, designing a different to standard calibrator _(a kind of concept to which we are not going to turn again)_

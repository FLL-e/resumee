**DATE** From feb to oct 2019

Hardware Quality Assurance engineer at HP Inc, working in [large-format/indrustrial printers](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/commercial-printers/latex-printers/products.html). Some of my tasks:
- Planification and execution of **System Errors**, mostly by **designing and triggering** electronic hardware malfunctions on their PCBs _(yes I was being paid for breaking the printers)_
- **Manage the documents** related to System Error and testing, as well as change request for test fails _(It may looks like normal documentation but I create a pretty useful excel and some scripts to manage all the attached data)_
- **Validate System Diagnostics**, running them in "normal/working" and malfunction scenario, analysing their outputs/report and giving feedback about fixes and implementation _(those printers use linux and tcl scripts so I could play a bit with them)_

When you messed up with the ink pumps... ![prototype](https://fll-e.github.io/resumee/assets/images/pumpfail.jpg)



Also, I learned a thing or two about that _asset deploying_ thing, I mean... consultors working at client sites.

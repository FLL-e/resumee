**DATE** 2018

I worked in a pilot project to monitor electricity distribution, using small wireless sensors. I handled and wrote all the technical documentation of the project: from requirements to the final evaluation report of the technology. During the process I designed the test plan for the HW involved and analysed its results.

I learn about the commercial relation consultory-client, from the preliminary meetings to the end of the project, how to manage documentation and tasks, presentation to client... and visit some cool places that normally you cant access (pending to add photos)


Mostly of this time **I was working in 3 projects simultaneously**.

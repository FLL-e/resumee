I'm an industrial electronic engineer and, as electronic, I like hardware! But software and firmware have always been there because digital electronics is what appealed to me from the beginning. Based on that, I like to work maintaining contact with HW and its design at the same time that I'm involved in its FW development

Currently I'm living in town next to Barcelona
